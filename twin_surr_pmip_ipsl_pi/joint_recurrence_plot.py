    """
    Class JointRecurrencePlot for generating and quantitatively analyzing
    :index:`joint recurrence plots <single: joint recurrence plot>`.

    The JointRecurrencePlot class supports the construction of joint recurrence
    plots from two multi-dimensional time series, optionally using embedding.
    Currently, manhattan, euclidean and supremum norms are provided for
    measuring distances in phase space.

    Methods for calculating commonly used measures of :index:`recurrence
    quantification analysis <pair: RQA; joint recurrence plot>` (RQA) are
    provided, e.g., determinism, maximum diagonal line length and laminarity.
    The definitions of these measures together with a review of the theory and
    applications of joint recurrence plots are given in [Marwan2007]_.

    **Examples:**

     - Create an instance of JointRecurrencePlot with a fixed recurrence
       threshold and without embedding::

           JointRecurrencePlot(x, y, threshold=(0.1,0.2))

     - Create an instance of JointRecurrencePlot with a fixed recurrence
       threshold in units of STD and without embedding::

           JointRecurrencePlot(x, y, threshold_std=(0.03,0.05))

     - Create an instance of JointRecurrencePlot at a fixed recurrence rate and
       using time delay embedding::

           JointRecurrencePlot(
               x, y, dim=(3,5), tau=(2,1),
               recurrence_rate=(0.05,0.04)).recurrence_rate()

        dimension ``dim`` and delay ``tau`` are **both** given as keyword
