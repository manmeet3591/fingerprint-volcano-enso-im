    """
    Generating and quantitatively analyzing inter-system recurrence networks.

    For a inter-system recurrence network, time series x and y do not need to
    have the same length! Formally, nodes are identified with state vectors in
    the common phase space of both time series. Hence, the time series need to
    have the same number of dimensions and identical physical units.
    Undirected links are added to describe recurrences within x and y as well
    as cross-recurrences between x and y. Self-loops are excluded in this
    undirected network representation.

    More information on the theory and applications of inter system recurrence
    networks can be found in [Feldhoff2012]_.

    **Examples:**

     - Create an instance of InterSystemRecurrenceNetwork with fixed
       recurrence thresholds and without embedding::

           InterSystemRecurrenceNetwork(x, y, threshold=(0.1, 0.2, 0.1))

     - Create an instance of InterSystemRecurrenceNetwork at a fixed
       recurrence rate and using time delay embedding::

           InterSystemRecurrenceNetwork(
               x, y, dim=3, tau=(2, 1), recurrence_rate=(0.05, 0.05, 0.02))

        Initialize an instance of InterSystemRecurrenceNetwork (ISRN).

        .. note::
           For an inter system recurrence network, time series x and y need to
           have the same number of dimensions!

        Creates an embedding of the given time series x and y, calculates a
        inter system recurrence matrix from the embedding and then creates
        an InteractingNetwork object from this matrix, interpreting the inter
        system recurrence matrix as the adjacency matrix of an undirected
        complex network.

        Either recurrence thresholds ``threshold`` or
        recurrence rates ``recurrence_rate`` have to be given as keyword
        arguments.

        Embedding is only supported for scalar time series. If embedding
        dimension ``dim`` and delay ``tau`` are **both** given as keyword
        arguments, embedding is applied. Multidimensional time series are
        processed as is by default.
