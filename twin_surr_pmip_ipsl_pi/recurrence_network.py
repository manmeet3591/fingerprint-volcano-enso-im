    Class RecurrenceNetwork for generating and quantitatively analyzing
    recurrence networks.

    More information on the theory and applications of recurrence networks can
    be found in [Marwan2009]_, [Donner2010b]_.

    Examples:

     - Create an instance of RecurrenceNetwork with a fixed recurrence
       threshold and without embedding::

           RecurrenceNetwork(time_series, threshold=0.1)

     - Create an instance of RecurrenceNetwork at a fixed (global) recurrence
       rate and using time delay embedding::

           RecurrenceNetwork(time_series, dim=3, tau=2,
                             recurrence_rate=0.05).recurrence_rate()

        plot from the embedding and then creates a Network object from the
        recurrence plot, interpreting the recurrence matrix as the adjacency
        matrix of a complex network.

        rate ``recurrence_rate`` or local recurrence rate
        ``local_recurrence_rate`` have to be given as keyword arguments.

        Embedding is only supported for scalar time series. If embedding
        dimension ``dim`` and delay ``tau`` are **both** given as keyword
        arguments, embedding is applied. Multidimensional time series are
